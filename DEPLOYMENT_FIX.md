# Authentication Fix for Production Deployment

## Issues Fixed

The 401/400 authentication errors were caused by several configuration mismatches between development and production environments:

### 1. CORS Configuration
- **Problem**: Server was only configured for localhost origins
- **Fix**: Updated CORS to accept multiple origins including production domain

### 2. Cookie Settings
- **Problem**: Cookies were using `sameSite: "strict"` which blocks cross-site requests in production
- **Fix**: Updated to use `sameSite: "none"` in production while keeping `"strict"` for development

### 3. Environment Variables
- **Problem**: Environment variables pointed to localhost instead of production URLs
- **Fix**: Created separate `.env.production` files for both client and server

## Deployment Configuration

### Server Environment Variables (Render)
Set these environment variables in your Render dashboard:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=dea598f41122e5c65ec2e1037d3af7ba331f3e2cb7769fe29a9010cbc42e75ac1d0840f82ffb476aae0a075aad580ef19001ea25eb353c2290b59144c1150350
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=42310d5fbedf396a68c4c81da75113f06755053b62bc393297f776d6bf7eaa132cdb0c8817ed7281a3ca750c57cad9c0e3e731b47962ed6c7275678e6ffe1fbe
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://khai_user:StrongPassword123@cluster0.cg5qmur.mongodb.net/ai_talent_finder?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
REDIS_URL=redis://default:hnGLE8iVRYpnGVleuJjCq44iZHmYZTM0@redis-16441.c276.us-east-1-2.ec2.redns.redis-cloud.com:16441
VITE_API_URL=https://ai-talent-finder-t1h6.onrender.com
CLIENT_URL=https://ai-talent-finder-t1h6.onrender.com
PORT=8000
```

### Client Environment Variables (Vercel)
Set this environment variable in your Vercel dashboard:

```bash
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://ai-talent-finder-t1h6.onrender.com
```

## Key Changes Made

### 1. server/src/server.js
- Updated CORS to accept multiple origins including production domain
- Added array of allowed origins with fallback filtering

### 2. server/controllers/auth.js
- Updated cookie settings to use conditional `sameSite` based on environment
- Production uses `sameSite: "none"` for cross-site cookies
- Development continues using `sameSite: "strict"`

### 3. server/middleware/auth.js
- Applied same cookie setting changes to middleware

### 4. Environment Files
- Created `.env.production` files for both client and server
- Separated development and production configurations

## Testing

After deployment, test these endpoints:
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Should return user data when authenticated
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Should refresh tokens properly
- Login/logout flow should work without 401/400 errors

## Security Notes

- `sameSite: "none"` requires `secure: true` (HTTPS)
- This configuration is secure for production but allows cross-site cookie usage
- Development continues to use stricter settings for local testing
