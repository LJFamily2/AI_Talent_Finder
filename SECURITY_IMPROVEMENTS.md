# Security Improvements - JWT httpOnly Cookies Implementation

## Summary of Changes

This implementation replaces localStorage-based JWT storage with secure httpOnly cookies to prevent XSS attacks.

## Server-Side Changes

### 1. Updated Authentication Controller (`server/controllers/auth.js`)

- Modified `sendTokenResponse()` to set httpOnly cookies instead of returning tokens in response body
- Updated `refresh()` endpoint to read refresh token from cookies
- Added `logout()` endpoint to clear cookies
- Cookie settings:
  - `httpOnly: true` - Prevents JavaScript access
  - `secure: true` (production) - HTTPS only
  - `sameSite: 'strict'` - CSRF protection
  - Access token: 15 minutes expiry
  - Refresh token: 7 days expiry

### 2. Updated Authentication Middleware (`server/middleware/auth.js`)

- Modified to read access token from cookies first
- Maintains backward compatibility with Authorization header

### 3. Updated Server Configuration (`server/src/server.js`)

- Added `cookie-parser` middleware
- Updated CORS configuration with `credentials: true`

### 4. Updated Routes (`server/routes/auth.js`)

- Added logout route: `POST /api/auth/logout`

### 5. Added Dependencies

- Installed `cookie-parser` package

## Client-Side Changes

### 1. Updated AuthContext (`client/src/context/AuthContext.jsx`)

- Removed localStorage usage
- Added `axios.defaults.withCredentials = true`
- Modified refresh timer logic (can't decode httpOnly cookies)
- Updated login/register to work with cookie-based responses
- Enhanced logout to call server logout endpoint

### 2. Updated API Configuration (`client/src/config/api.js`)

- Added `withCredentials: true` to axios instance
- Removed manual token attachment (cookies sent automatically)
- Simplified response interceptor

### 3. Added Content Security Policy (`client/index.html`)

- Basic CSP header to mitigate XSS attacks
- Restricts script sources and connections

## Security Benefits

✅ **XSS Protection**: Tokens stored in httpOnly cookies can't be accessed by JavaScript
✅ **CSRF Protection**: `sameSite: 'strict'` prevents cross-site requests
✅ **Secure Transport**: `secure: true` ensures HTTPS-only transmission in production
✅ **Content Security Policy**: Additional XSS protection layer

## Environment Variables Required

Add to your server `.env` file:

```
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

## Testing the Implementation

1. Start the server: `cd server && npm start`
2. Start the client: `cd client && npm run dev`
3. Test login/logout functionality
4. Verify tokens are stored as httpOnly cookies (check browser DevTools > Application > Cookies)
5. Verify JavaScript cannot access tokens: `document.cookie` should not show auth tokens

## Migration Notes

- Users will need to log in again after this update
- The implementation maintains backward compatibility with Authorization headers during transition
- Consider implementing a migration script to handle existing user sessions

## Future Enhancements

- Implement additional rate limiting
- Add request signing for API endpoints
- Consider implementing refresh token rotation
- Add audit logging for authentication events
