# 🔄 Update Log – July 19, 2025

## ✅ CLI Refactor & Frontend Preparation

### 🛠 Summary
- Extracted all CLI rendering logic into a new file: `renderCli.js`
- Standardized CLI command prompts for a consistent user experience
- Synced structural flow between `authorCli.js` and `filterCli.js`

### 📦 Files Modified / Added
- `authorCli.js`
- `filterCli.js`
- `cli.js`
- ➕ `renderCli.js` (new)

### 🧭 CLI Features after Refactor
- `r` → Flush Redis cache
- `f` → Fetch authors from OpenAlex
- `d<No>` → Delete profile by index
- `n`, `p`, `b`, `m` → Page and menu navigation

## 🎯 Preparing for Frontend Integration

### Why `renderCli.js` was created
- To separate CLI UI rendering from business logic
- Makes it easier to reuse rendering logic in a future frontend (React or other)
- Avoids rewriting display logic when transitioning from CLI to web UI

### Backend APIs relevant for future frontend (FE)

#### 🔍 Author search & candidate list
- `GET /api/author/search-author` (query MongoDB)
- `GET /api/author/fetch-author` (fetch from OpenAlex)

#### 🧪 Multi-filter search (MongoDB + OpenAlex)
- `GET /api/search-filters/multi` (MongoDB multi-filter)
- `GET /api/search-filters/openalex` (experimental OpenAlex filter)
- `GET /api/search-filters/by-topic`, `by-country`, `by-hindex`, `by-i10index`, `with-identifier`

#### 📂 View and manage profile details
- `GET /api/author/detail` (get full profile from MongoDB)
- `POST /api/author/save-profile`
- `DELETE /api/author/delete-profile`

> Note: The OpenAlex multi-filter endpoint is a custom extension added to explore advanced search scenarios. Will be reviewed during tonight’s meeting.

## 🧹 Additional Notes

- Redis logs show `HIT`, `MISS`, `SET`, `DEL` clearly in both CLI and server
- Default TTL for all cache entries is 1 hour
- All author profiles follow a consistent JSON schema:
  - Includes `basic_info`, `identifiers`, `research_metrics`, `research_areas`, `citation_trends`, `current_affiliation`, and optionally `works`
